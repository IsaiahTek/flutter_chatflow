</p>
A powerful and flexible chat solution for Flutter apps. Features include real-time messaging, private chats, group chats, customizable UI, user management, media sharing, rich text support, typing user(s), etc.

## Features

1. Fast Messaging: The UI updates instantly as soon as it receives a new data. The developing sees to how the application stores the messages and it passes the same messages to the ChatFlow component for either private chats or group chats.
2. Customizable UI: Easily customizable chat themes, use builders to create more customized UI and layouts to match your appâ€™s design.
3. User Management: Support for user authentication and profile management.
4. Media Sharing: Send and receive images, videos, and other media files.
5. Group Chats: Create and manage group conversations effortlessly.
6. Generic Media Type: Aside from the default message types which include Text, Image, Info, Audio, Video, PDF, Doc and File, there's a Custom type for you to extend and do more just in case the already available types aren't enough which we believe should be enough for most use cases.
7. Typing User: Listen to user typing events and do what you want such as notifying other users in the chat about that event.
8. Media Preview: By default, chatflow automatically shows images preview when a user taps on an image message. [See image above]
9. Select Message: A user can select message(s) in the chat. You get the list of selected message(s) and do what you want by providing a callback. [See API in Documentation]
10. Message Reply: Messages can be replied to easily. This makes your app more intuitive, modern and engaging.
<!-- 6. Rich Text Support: Emoji, links, and formatted text in messages. -->
Etc.
